  <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/)</strong>,[6] often abbreviated as JS,
    is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7]
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
    It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
    object-orientation, and first-class functions.

    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
    World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an
    essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for
    client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated
    JavaScript engine to execute it.
